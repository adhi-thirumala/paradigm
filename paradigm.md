I've decided to do version-control on this page; you can find previous versions at [my Github](github.com/adhi-thirumala/paradigm/paradigm.md)

Long story short, dishonorable victory is preferable to honest defeat. Because some people have misinterpreted this line in the past, this does NOT mean to do academic dishonesty.

I've been every speaker position, gone for every kind of argument, and debated at every level of the activity from the most lay to the most circuit. This used to be a lot longer. I thought that I needed to express all these random thoughts about the activity, but as I kept going on, I realized that I don't actually care that much. Debate made me happy in high school, and I enjoyed doing it. One of the few things that caused me anguish while I competed was judge intervention, either at the level where they would enforce argument preference, or at the level where they would make poor technical decisions and not take the simplest path to a victory. Part of what made the activity so fun was going for whatever positions I wanted, whether they were "honorable" or not. I will try my hardest to listen to whatever is in front of me because at the end of the day, the debate is about you, the debaters, not me.

I will intervene and end the round only in one of the three following circumstances.
1. A debater asking to end the round.
2. A debater not capable of communicating to me that they would like the debate to continue (e.g. someone unconscious, linguistic barrier, etc.)
3. Tabroom telling me to make a decision in a certain manner.

A couple of thoughts from an older version of this document that I think are still necessary for me to express.
1. Remember to have offense. Posturing and asserting that your opponent has gone for a "bad" argument does nothing to beat back the "badness" of it. This applies a lot in theory, competition, and topicality debates a lot. Having strong vision in these debates is something that will result in high speaker points.
2. Send me emails with proper subjects, **WORD** documents with proper names and headers, and time your prep. Preferably nothing in the body of an email either. My computer is already cluttered; don't make it worse.
3. I don't want a card document. I think most judge screws come from judges going rogue and reading evidence. I will try my hardest not to do this unless instructed to by debaters. I also think that card documents give debaters an incentive to add cards not extended or rewrite headers to imply arguments not made. I don't want to deal with that.
4. I find myself in a lot of clash debates now. I guess that's the price to pay for someone that's argumentatively agnostic, and I now understand why a lot of the judges I preffed high as a debater found themselves here. After judging a fair amount of these, I've found modern T - USFG debates boring when they're just brute forces of the "microaggression" vs the "fairness paradox". Please innovate on both sides to prevent my soul from wasting away in clash purgatory. Examples include cool carded T arguments that are takeouts to things like "microaggressions evaluation good", "subjectivity shift", or "K v K debates good". The same applies to the affirmatives in these debates. I also think that this strategy will help you a lot more than "go to tab + guilt dissuastion" vs "tab is biased against *insert group*". To be fair, this doesn't change the way I'll evaluate such debates, but it can boost my value to life during the monotony that is online debate which is a good thing for all of us.

Now, to end this page, imagine that I quoted that line about science fiction, trolls, and blank checks.
