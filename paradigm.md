I've decided to do version-control on this page; you can find previous versions at [my github](github.com/adhi-thirumala/paradigm/paradigm.md)

I've been every speaker position, gone for every kind of argument, and debated at every level of the activity from the most lay to the most circuit. This used to be a lot longer. I thought that I needed to express all these random thoughts about the activity, but as I kept going on, I realized that I don't actually care that much. Now, imagine that I quoted that line about science fiction, trolls, and blank checks.
I will intervene and end the round only in one of the three following circumstances.
1. A debater asking to end the round.
2. A debater not capable of communicating to me that they would like the debate to continue (e.g. someone unconscious, linguistic barrier, etc.)
3. Tabroom telling me to make a decision in a certain manner.

A couple of thoughts from an older version of this document that I think are still necessary for me to express.
1. Remember to have offense. Posturing and asserting that your opponent has gone for a "bad" argument does nothing to beat back the "badness" of it.
2. Send me emails with proper subjects, **WORD** documents with proper names and headers, and time your prep. Preferably nothing in the body of an email either. My computer is already cluttered; don't make it worse.
3. I don't want a card document. I think most judge screws come from judges going rogue and reading evidence. I will try my hardest not to do this unless instructed to by debaters. I also think that card documents give debaters an incentive to add cards not extended or rewrite headers to imply arguments not made. I don't want to deal with that.
