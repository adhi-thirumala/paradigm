University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign '28 ('27?)

If you are going to UIUC next year and want to continue debate, contact me. We will likely have a policy squad with a couple of teams and would appreciate any help that we could get whether its research help or actually debating. There's no "real" program, and we don't have money or coaches or anything. Also if you are committed, strike me.

I've decided to do version-control on this page; you can find previous versions at [my Github](github.com/adhi-thirumala/paradigm/paradigm.md)

Long story short, dishonorable victory is preferable to honest defeat. Because some people have misinterpreted this line in the past, this does NOT mean to do academic dishonesty.

I've been every speaker position, gone for every kind of argument, and debated at every level of the activity from the most lay to the most circuit. This used to be a lot longer. I thought that I needed to express all these random thoughts about the activity, but as I kept going on, I realized that I don't actually care that much. (UPDATE: I do care actually. This document gets bigger after every tournament.) Debate made me happy in high school, and I enjoyed doing it. One of the few things that caused me anguish while I competed was judge intervention, either at the level where they would enforce argument preference, or at the level where they would make poor technical decisions and not take the simplest path to a victory. Part of what made the activity so fun was going for whatever positions I wanted, whether they were "honorable" or not. I will try my hardest to listen to whatever is in front of me because at the end of the day, the debate is about you, the debaters, not me.

I will intervene and end the round only in one of the three following circumstances.
1. A debater asking to end the round.
2. A debater not capable of communicating to me that they would like the debate to continue (e.g. someone unconscious, linguistic barrier, etc.)
3. Tabroom telling me to make a decision in a certain manner.

A couple of thoughts from an older version of this document that I think are still necessary for me to express (and some that are new).
1. Remember to have offense. Posturing and asserting that your opponent has gone for a "bad" argument does nothing to beat back the "badness" of it. This applies a lot in theory, competition, and topicality debates a lot. Having strong vision in these debates is something that will result in high speaker points.
2. Send me emails with proper subjects, **WORD** documents with proper names and headers. Preferably nothing in the body of an email either. My computer is already cluttered; don't make it worse. It is the TOC. You are all debaters at the top of this activity. I do not want to see a PDF in my email.
3. I don't want a card document. I think most judge screws come from judges going rogue and reading evidence. I will try my hardest not to do this unless instructed to by debaters. I also think that card documents give debaters an incentive to add cards not extended or rewrite headers to imply arguments not made. I don't want to deal with that.
4. I find myself in a lot of clash debates now. I guess that's the price to pay for someone that's argumentatively agnostic, and I now understand why a lot of the judges I preffed high as a debater found themselves here. After judging a fair amount of these, I've found modern T - USFG debates boring when they're just brute forces of the "microaggression" vs the "fairness paradox". Please innovate on both sides to prevent my soul from wasting away in clash purgatory. Examples include cool carded T arguments that are takeouts to things like "microaggressions evaluation good", "subjectivity shift", or "K v K debates good". The same applies to the affirmatives in these debates. I also think that this strategy will help you a lot more than "go to tab + guilt assuasion" vs "tab is biased against *insert group*". To be fair, this doesn't change the way I'll evaluate such debates, but it can boost my value to life during the monotony that is online debate which is a good thing for all of us.
5. It is better to fill in offense than to create defense out of nothing. What does this mean? Imagine that the 1AR does not extend an internal link to an impact and just makes terminal impact claims, but the 2NR never extends an internal link defense argument. Now imagine that the 2AR once again only extends a terminal impact. What does one do here? Some judges would not vote for the advantage because the 2AR didn't extend an internal link.  Inevitably, these judges get post-rounded, get asked the question "where did the 2NR say this", and then fold. Inversely, if judges vote affirmative, then the case for "Why did you vote aff when the 2AR didn't extend an internal link" is simple: "I was not told to do such a thing." It might seem obvious what to do in this specific scenario, but these scenarios show up in much more complicated debates all the time. Debate is more about the burden of rejoinder than the burden of proof. 
6. I don't judge kick by default. My justification for this it that it seems to be interventionist to make a decision without either teams asking me to do so, almost akin to filling in defense arbitrarily by kicking a counterplan. I think that judge kick is likely truthfully a good thing, and if the block/2NR says some amount of words, it is hard for the affirmative to articulate an alternative to judge kick without winning condo (and rarely does it invest precious 1AR time into doing so).
7. Time prep yourself. In varsity, I generally trust debaters enough to do such a thing. Honestly, I forget to time it myself a lot of the time.
8. Postround me. Disagreement is the highest form of respect (we're in DEBATE). I am a lowly first-year who is only slightly better than average at flowing. Debate is quite stressful, and talking it out after a round is certainly better than ruminating on a round for much time after. Taking that into account, I understand if you get slightly heated in a postround and won't hold it against you personally at all. You are all high-schoolers. I am an adult. It would be weird for me to hold grudges or get needlessly enraged at you.
9. This has now come up in two debates. If someone says the argument "reject the argument not the team" on a theory flow, I will NOT presume that to be a counterinterpretation. I will just presume that to be an instruction of what to do if the other team wins that their interpretation is preferable.
10. It's probably suspect to say "please don't read death good" against us and apply that to wipeout debates such as AGI, animals etc. The argument is not actually Also, it seems like you forfeit the right to complain about such arguments if you read an extinction impact first. Reading (what is probably an incorrect) metaethic and then complaining about its perverse implications is a bit nonsensical.
11. 
Now, to end this page, imagine that I quoted that line about science fiction, trolls, and blank checks.
