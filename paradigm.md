There's a lot of stuff here. It's really disorganized, but I think its a small insight into the way that I think about this activity. While I do hope you read it all, the next two statements summarize what I would like to see in a debate.

It is better to win dishonestly than lose with honor. (since someone misconstrued this, i’ll specify what i mean. this does not mean “do academic dishonesty” but rather it means that you should be scrappy and always look for an out in a debate instead of conceding, even if the out is dumb (dropped theory, 1AR impact turn, etc.)
Don't send me ugly speech documents.

MUST READ SECTION ON COMPUTER USAGE.

I have decided to move the following statement from the bottom of my paradigm to the top. It seems as if most of you all were not reading it, and it is far more important than the nonsense below it. Novices, this still applies to you. You are novices in debate; not novices in computer usage.

Prefer email chain over speechdrop, but if the tournament mandates it, I guess it's categorically predictable.

Individual instances of refusing to follow below formatting guidelines are worth -.2 speaker points each. You can lose a maximum of 2 speaker points from this. Think that's a lot? Learn to use a computer.

UPDATE End of St. Mark's Heart of Texas - Don't send me a link to an individual document in your Dropbox.

UPDATE End of Mid America Cup - Don't send me a onedrive link to an Office Online word document.

UPDATE End of Michigan Camp Tournament - Don't send me a Google document.

UPDATE End of Day 1 at the Michigan Camp Tournament - I have decided to take a stance. No "cards in the body." Take prep time or whatever, I don't care, but send me a nicely named doc with your singular 1AR card please.

While I don't care about the content of the debate, I do have significant preferences of the ways in which you communicate to me as a judge. It is 2024; figure out how to use your computer. Email chains should be named properly with the names of the teams debating, the tournament, and the round number. Emails should be sent near instantaenously after stopping prep. Docs should be named past "1NC(5).docx" as to not clutter up my desktop; preferably they are also named with tournament name and round. Fun fact, Verbatim has a built in feature to link with Tabroom and name your docs nicely for you. Sending PDFs caps your points at a 27. If anyone complains about "Word costing money" and "Google docs being accessible", every program that you use to send speech docs can export a word document as easily as a PDF, and Word doesn't have to cost money if you look hard enough.

If the aff is not new, the email chain should start before the round. In fact, why not even just send the email whenever you get the pairing. Its not as if the document will change from the version on the wiki, so you might as well send it and then start pre-round prep. Don't send late emails ever. Every minute is equal to one formatting violation.

I don't want a card doc. It it is absurdly easy to cheat. I know what you all get up to with adding cards and headers in the card doc, and I do not want to be a part of it.

Real paradigm starts here:

I have done every speaking position, gone for every type of argument, and debated on all kinds of circuits from the most lay to the most circuit. All I want to see is a debate where both sides try to win as hard as possible. I have little to no ideological preferences; above all, teams ought to make decisions that maximize their chances of winning. Intervening into a debate seems indefensible, and absurdly disrespectful to the debaters. Judges have (functionally) unlimited judging opportunities, but debaters have a limited career. I want to see you at your best, defending the arguments that make you the happiest.

Speaker points will reflect how well you know what you are doing. I enjoy every argument as long as it is executed well. This isn't to say I don't care about card quality. I most certainly do, but card quality can come from coaches, or even the wiki. Good in-round explanation of arguments is far more compelling to me when I go to assign speaker points, whether it is of the above concepts, or of topic/position specific knowledge.

"It's bad form for judges to base decisions in rogue evidence-reading. I'll read evidence as instructed or to break ties when debating is extremely shallow on both sides." - Ian Mackey-Piccolo (before he went through his weekly paradigm change)

I will end the round in one of two scenarios.

1. Someone (Tabroom/Debater/Law Enforcement) tells me to end the round.

2. A debater is incapable of communicating to me whether they want to continue the round.



"I am open to a Technical Knockout. This means that the debate is unwinnable for one team. If you think this is the case, say "TKO" (probably after your opponents' speech, not yours) and explain why it is unwinnable. If I agree, I will give you 30s and a W. If I disagree and think they can still win the debate, you'll get 25s and an L. Examples include: dropped T argument, dropped conditionality, double turn on the only relevant pieces of offense, dropped CP + DA without any theoretical out.

Be mindful of context: calling this against sophomores in presets looks worse than against an older team in a later prelim. But sometimes, debates are just slaughters, nobody is learning anything, and there will be nothing to judge. I am open to giving you some time back, and to adding a carrot to spice up debate." - Debnil Sur



LD UPDATE FOR GLENBROOKS BELOW

I wrote a bunch of musings below, but the most important one is that I'm pretty sure the negative should almost always win. There are NCs that seem impossible to answer sufficiently in 4 minutes. The negative not doing that is almost self-sabotage.

No idea what the resolution is, but I think it has something to do with taxes which was (not actually) a part of the topic last year, so I should understand most concepts.

I have very little experience with national circuit LD beyond talking to a couple friends who do it and competing in lay, local western Pennsylvania LD as a freshman (which caused me to want to quit the activity completely). However, I feel like I am good for a lot of the nonsense that happens in this format, moreso than some of the other people that I have seen. For reference, the teams that I coach in policy go for Kant aggressively on the neg and read Levinas occasionally on the aff. I read a tricks shell vs a kritikal affirmative sometimes in high school as well. This is not to say that I am bad for traditional policy debates in LD as well. Modern policy arguments coming to LD such as process counterplans, a more technical version of the fiat K, con con, etc. are all things that I would enjoy seeing in a debate in front of me. And of course, if you read a large, center of the topic plan, and go for the topic DA, I am clearly capable of judging you, albeit a bit confused on why you don't abuse the broken aspects of LD as an activity.

I would be happy to see what this activity uniquely offers over policy (Tricks and Phil). I'm not the best flow, and the reason that this is bad for these debates is that my low-level experience with them will mean that I don't know what to look for when flowing, I just hear words not thoughts. This means that you should at the very least deliver tricks in a flowable manner (numbered, pauses in between arguments).

I have a couple of questions about the fundamental format of the activity that I have not been able to resolve after thinking about the activity. Executing any of these things in a debate will give both debaters 30 speaks if it makes me less confused about it after. I haven't checked if GBX allows ties, but if they don't, the winner will get a 30 and the loser will get 29.9.

What happens when the 1AR reads a new impact, and the NR impact turns it with something like an S-Risk, who wins? For example, take the scenario in which the 1AC reads a normal plan, and says the standard is hedonic act utilitarianism. The 1NC concedes the standard and introduces the capitalism kritik. the 1AR in this scenario is almost forced to say capitalism bad. Imagine that they say capitalism causes space colonization and the alternative of socialism forecloses that. Now imagine that the NR reads a carded impact turn that says that space colonization causes non-human animals to spread throughout the universe, thus creating a large amount of animal suffering throughout the cosmos as they reproduce with R-Selection (this is an actual argument that some read). There are a couple of arguments that I think are completely unworkable. First is the argument that the NR gets defense but not offense against these impacts, or that the 2AR gets defense but not offense against the new impact to the impact turn. This seems arbitrary. The line between offense and defense seems logical to us, but any argument justifying new defense logically should justify new offense. The next is the one that says "xxx team already agreed that x impact is bad, they don't get to impact turn" as a response to something like spark or wipeout. The main argument here is that such a team has not disagreed with the reasons why extinction/nuclear war are bad, but rather just provided impacts which outweigh them. The 2AR has two options here. If it is true that the 2AR does not get new cards regardless of new 2AR arguments, it should automatically lose. The neg has introduced an impact that outweighs extinction and is valid under the affirmative's standard, so try-or-die should flip neg. Alternatively the 2AR does get new cards, and instantly wins because it gets new arguments that the neg cannot respond to. Imagine it is something more heinous, the AC does not read a nuclear war impact, and the NC reads a nuclear war impact. The 1AR says spark, thus impact turning nuclear war. This is a case in which the NR is almost forced to read new impacts to generate non-nuclear war offense, absent which it will almost certainly lose the debate. If there are scenarios to force the NR to read new offense, does this favor the aff or the neg? As of now, I think the aff should win these debates because clearly they get new cards to answer new cards, but every LD debater has disagreed with me on this. Help me figure this one out. The 1AR should read an impact turn, and the NR should impact turn the impact to the 1AR impact turn. It's even better if a team reads an S-Risk in this scenario, as to beat nebulous impact calculus claims and to force new cards.

I want to see a process counterplan debate where the model of purely functional competition is introduced in the NC alongside a process counterplan instead of waiting for the 1AR to say textual + functional and reading a shell in the NR. I feel as if such a debate is fully unwinnable for the neg since the 2AR would definitely get new answers to the new NR countermodel. A debate in which the neg starts this debate in the NC makes it far more winnable for the neg, especially considering I think truth is on the side of the neg. Reading standards for a process counterplan that competes off of immediacy and certainty as opposed to just reading definitions would also be something that I would like to see, and would avert the same problem.



Note for novice debates: This is not the varsity divison, it honestly doesn't matter, and you have a long career in front of you.Thrashing your opponents badly here on arguments they can't comprehend seems pointless. Alas, I'll still evaluate nonsense and tomfoolery and give speaker points normally. However, reading troll arguments that your varsity members send you without a deep understanding of themmight result in you accidentally own-goaling yourself. Don't use this paradigm and my preference for certain arguments as a guide for what you should read. It's better to practice fundamentals here and get argument-agnostic skills that will help you in the long-run.

Below are random musings I have of the activity. Do not take them as preferences I have, but rather what I think debate looks like asymptotically, with perfect debating/judging. Most of them are on the more theoretical sides of debate, where most debaters lack competence and make round-ending mistakes, sometimes as early as the block.

Predictability outweighs. For more information, see this paper. Long story short, the Limits DA from T---Subsets and the "We need to have debates about the race war" DA from the Race War aff are the same argument.

Textual competition is probably mind-poison. Definitions based PDCP arguments are much easier to defend.

You do not need to fill speech time. Sometimes, as stated above, your opponents make game-ending mistakes on theory debates. Instead of wasting my time and pretending to extend other things, extend the argument as fast as possible and sit down. For example, 1AR drops a subpoint such as "theory frames competition" on a textual-functional competition debate. The 2NR should be no more than 2 minutes explaining why such a drop is an instaloss.



I think that I have to specify if I judge kick or not by default. I've never been in a round where this has been relevant. I'll update this line when it is.

Fairness in K debates seems logically very small of an impact. However, it is also probably the best impact. The thing with fairness is that if I actually am ever in a position to weigh it against the racism impact on the "topicality is an Indian spirit murder microaggression" DA, then logically, any risk of preventing harm to a debater in round would outweigh, even if it that requires me to vote for something that collapses debate. Think of these debates as wipeout debates, the K teams offense categorically comes before yours similar to S-Risks and extinction. You need to win that it doesn't.

Many kritikal teams fall victim to the statement "Play stupid games; win stupid prizes." Many dumb arguments in debate are unbeatable absent a theoretical justification of why they are bad. For example, PIKs out of small 1AC things (problematic authors, problematic parts of the cite ( ͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °), problematic phrases) are all hard to defend against without the backing of "framework: debate is about the plan", "no subjectivity", and "no microaggression eval". Almost every K aff cannot say this, lest they instantly zero every piece of T offense they have. Negative teams should take advantage of this. K teams posturing and using ethos against arguments that "seem dumb" does not constitute offense.(This used to be a statement about how kritikal teams would asssert that "x argument" is stupid and clearly doesn't rejoind without making the proper framework argument to beat it. I now realize that it applies to many teams who face arguments that they think are "bad." If it is so bad, get offense. If you can't generate offense, perhaps it is a good argument.)



The ad-hom is an argument, but a bad one. I am extremely pre-disposed on voting on a set of arguments that combines "going to tab solves if we actually did something" with "the judge shouldnt make ethical determinations through the ballot" with "they should lose for introducing them and losing the ad-hom debate even if they dont go for them because anything else incentivizes no-cost spamming of ad-homs." I don't see a team being able to credibly beat this given a coherent explanation of those arguments. Alternatively, you should actually end the round and go to tabroom yourself. I don't think the tournament will ever take the side of a team who has introduced out-of-round screenshots/ad-homs in a debate.
